# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using a basic machine learning approach.
The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on given medical features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset is used for this project.
It contains various features related to cell characteristics and a diagnosis label.

## Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Visualized results using tables and graphs

## Results
The model provides good accuracy in classifying tumors.
Performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding the basic workflow of a machine learning classification problem,
including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
